# Applied Time Series Analysis - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the course on Applied Time Series Analysis. The project showcases an in-depth exploration of time series data analysis, modeling, and forecasting techniques applied to real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to leverage time series analysis techniques to model and forecast trends in the dataset under study. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), various time series modeling approaches, and evaluating the models' performance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and forecasting.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model implementation.
- `results/`: Visualizations, forecasts, and evaluation metrics.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data transformations, and preparing the time series data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, seasonality, and outliers.
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - ARIMA/SARIMA models for baseline time series modeling.
  - Other models like ETS for more comparing forecasting.
  - Machine learning approaches such as LSTM for complex patterns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models based on metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishita3003/Applied-Time-Series-Final-Project.git
cd Applied-Time-Series-Final-Project
```

Simply run the R markdown file, to see the outputs. Make sure to change the path of the data file according to your location on csv file.
